# Comparing Regression and Classification Models for Salary Prediction

First run the glassdoor_scrapper.py and Web_scraping_jobs.ipynb files. This will scrap the data from glassdoor and indeed job sites respectively and convert them to csv format. Since we have already extraceted the job entries from the web sites you may skip this step. Then we have cleaned the data extracted from these sites. Run data_cleaning.ipynb and job_data_processing_eda.ipynb files to clean glassdoor and indeed data respectively. The cleaned data is then stored in seperate csv files. This step has also been done and the cleaned data has been added as a part of our code and thus you may skip this step as well. The data_eda file and job_data_processing_eda files contain our exploratory data analysis step for glassdoor and indeed data respectively.  Before running the models download all requirements in the requirements.txt file. After this step you may run the models. The model_building.py file contains the regression models which are random forest and multiple linear regression models. The salary_modelling_master.ipynb file contains the implementation of our classification models which is tf-idf and mixed input network model. Their accuracy has been compared. Since tf-idf model performed better the same has been used for final api. We have implemented the UI in app.py file and have tested it with test.py file.
